Spam Detection: Flags emails from known spammy domains or with suspicious patterns.
Email Existence Check: Performs an SMTP handshake to verify if the email address exists.
User-Friendly GUI: Developed using tkinter for ease of use.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Tkinter: Used for the graphical user interface (GUI).
PIL (Pillow): For loading and displaying background images.
re: For regular expression-based email format validation.
dns.resolver: To verify domain MX records.
smtplib: For performing SMTP validation.
socket: Handles possible network issues during email existence checks.
